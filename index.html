        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a technique used in computer graphics and web design where background images move at a different rate than the foreground images or content as the user scrolls through a webpage or interface. This creates an illusion of depth and adds a dynamic element to the overall design.

            The term "parallax" refers to the apparent displacement or difference in the position of an object when viewed from two different vantage points. In the context of scrolling, it means that objects in the background appear to move more slowly than those in the foreground, mimicking the way objects at a distance move slower when you're moving.
            ,<br><br>
            Here's how parallax scrolling typically works:
            <br>
            1.Multiple Layers of Content: The webpage is divided into multiple layers or sections, each containing different elements like images, text, or other types of content.
            <br>
            2.Variable Scroll Rates: Each layer or section is programmed to move at a different speed or rate when the user scrolls. Background layers typically move slower than foreground layers.
            <br>
            3.User Interaction: As the user scrolls, the content in each layer moves accordingly based on its assigned scroll rate, creating the parallax effect.
            <br>
            The parallax effect can create a sense of immersion, visual interest, and depth, making the user experience more engaging. It's commonly used in various types of websites, especially in storytelling or landing pages, to enhance the aesthetics and make the site more interactive and captivating.
            <br><br>
            There are different types of parallax scrolling:
            <br>
            -Layered Parallax: Different layers move at different speeds, creating a multi-dimensional effect.
            <br>
            -Horizontal Parallax: Instead of vertical scrolling, the layers move horizontally as the user scrolls horizontally.
            <br>
            -Mouse-based Parallax: The layers' movement can be tied to the mouse movement, creating an interactive effect.
            <br>
            -Scrolling Parallax: The movement of layers is based on the user's scroll action, creating the classic parallax effect.
            <br>
            Parallax scrolling is achieved through a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web development. It's important to balance the effect so that it enhances the user experience without causing distraction or affecting the site's performance negatively.</p>
